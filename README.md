#Book Club:  Programming Ruby Group Style

This is a repository set up for the Gschool[1] reading group to discuss and code through Programming Ruby!

##### For each summary the assigned students will provide a framework - any other classmates can add tips and tricks or questions to any other chapter for discussion on Monday.

+ Five to Ten Bullets Points of Summary

+ Tips and Tricks
