The two main points of chapter five are the idea of inheritance (parent/child classes, sub/super classes) and modules.  
both deal with how classes can talk to one another and use methods within the class.  

Inheritance: 
1) The child class inherits all the of the capabilities of the parent class. This allows shortening of files because methods
don't need to be constantly re-written.  
2) Ruby is efficent at looking up through classes in order to find the method that is called.  In other words, if the method
isn't defined in the child class, it will keep looking through the parent class in order to find that method. Ruby is smart
like that.
3) BasicObject is the root class.  It is the highest in the hierarchy of classes.


Modules:
1) Namespace.  Allows methods to be created in a "sandbox", so they aren't confused by Ruby. For instance, if you have two 
files that both have the same method name, they won't get confused because they are bundled in the namespace.
2) Mixins are similiar to inheritance.  It is important to define classes rather than modules if there are instance variables 
in the initialize of your program.  
3) A Module is not a class.
4) Iterators can use the enumerables by adding "each".  This allows you to access a wide variety of methods. 

Confusion:
 Still a little unclear about adding enumerables.
