Chapter 8 - Cool stuff with methods!

Some basics about methods ===> Arguments(the stuff in parentheses after the method name) can have a default value.
                                             
                                              def method_name(argument = default value)
                                                  #awesome code...
                                              end
                              
                                A method can have more than one argument
                                              
                                              def method_name(argument1, argument2, argument3)
                                                  #awesome code...
                                              end
                                              
                                              
                                A method can have a Hash as an argument
                                
                                              def method_name(argument1, { :name => john
                                                                 :age  => 24
                                                                 :birth_day => "9/22/86"
                                                                })
                                                  #awesome code...
                                              end
                                              
A few things I didn't understand, or couldn't properly implement ===> Methods can take a block as an argument.
            The ampersand before the second arugment somehow allows a block to be passed in to the argument.
                       I think this allows loops, or equations to be used as an argument

                                            def method_name(arg1, &arg2)
                                                #awesome code...
                                            end
                                            
              A splat argument can be used if you want to have a changing number of arguments for a method.
The splat seems to remain nil if no value is assigned, or multiple values can be given (these values take the form of an array)        
            
            
                                          def method_name(arg1, *splat, arg2)
                                                #awesome code.....
                                          end
