#Chapter 7
##Regular Expressions 


###Summary

* <b>An Overview of what Regular Expressions</b>
	- Regular Expressions are used to match patterns against strings. They are difficult to understand at first and Thomas recommends coming back to this chapter later.
* <b>How Regular Expressions are used in Ruby</B>
	- Most common is to write a basic pattern between forward classes
		- for example: /cat/ to find "cat" 
	- Stings can be changed based on a pattern with the sub method
	- Unlike sub and gsub, sub! and gsub! return the string only if the pattern was matched. If no match for the pattern is found in the string, they return nil instead. This means it can make sense (depending on your need) to use the ! forms in conditions.
	- Using gsub:

```
str = "Dog and Cat"new_str = str.sub(/Cat/, "Gerbil")puts "Let's go to the #{new_str} for a pint."produces:Let's go to the Dog and Gerbil for a pint.
```
	
* <b>Digging Deeper</b>
	- You can create regular expression objects by calling Regexp class's new method or by using %r{â€¦} syntax
* <b>Advanced Regular Expressions</b>
	- Lookahead and Lookbehind methods are used want to match a pattern only if the matched substring is preceded by or followed by some other pattern.


###Tips and Tricks
* A link to flashcards based on the chapter: <http://quizlet.com/_ginwc>
* The Ruby operator =~ matches a string against a pattern
	- It returns the character offset into the string where the match occurred
	- /cat/ =~ "cat" will return 0
	- /cat/ =~ "and cat" will return 4
* The Ruby operator !~ is used to test non-matching
* In order to match a special character literally in a pattern, precede it with a backslash
	- for example: /\*/ looks for the asterisk

###Questions
* How often are REGEX patterns actually used? I've heard that they are often omitted due to being difficult to read. What is the standard use?
* Are there REGEX competitions? I'd like to know if programmers use REGEX as a method of proving mastery...
