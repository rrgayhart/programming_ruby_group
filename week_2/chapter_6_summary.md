1) Numbers are objects that can have methods called on them (like abs, to_s, real, 

imaginary, etc.) 


2) You may write hex and binary numbers by starting with 0x and 0b, respectively, 

and the return value is the decimal number we all know and love.

Example: 0b10 returns 2


3) You can use fractions in ruby (rational numbers) by using the built in Rational 

method.

Example: Rational(3, 4) * Rational(1, 2) = ½


4) Or complex numbers…

Example: Complex(1, 2) * Complex(3, 4) = -5+10i


5) You can require ‘mathn’ to access more complex functions when working with 

integers.


6) You can use .times, .upto, .downto, and .step(x, y) methods to work with integers 

(for example, you can use .upto if you want to count up from 1 to 10).


7) On strings, .squeeze removes characters that happen in a row.

Example: “baaaaaa”.squeeze returns “ba”

Questions:

1) What is a Struct? Book says: “A Struct is simply a data structure that contains a 

given set of attributes – for example title, name, and length.”
