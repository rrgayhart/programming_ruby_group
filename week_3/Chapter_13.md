#Chapter 13: Unit Testing

###Introduction
* "...all software is constructed in layers; code on one layer relies on the correct operation of the code in the layers below. If this underlying code turns out to contain bugs, then all higher layers are potentially affected" (198)
* Unit testing helps developers write better code because thinking about testing naturally leads you to think about the accuracy of your code and reveals feedback
* Flexibility of Ruby makes unit testing easy... run some of your code, get back results and check actual versus expected
