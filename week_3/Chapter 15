Ruby comes with a debugger, accessed with this code: $ ruby â€“r debug filename.rb

You can add a code profiler to find out number of times each method is called and average and cumulative time Ruby spends in those methods. Profiling adds a ton of time to the program, but will give you relative numbers to help source the area of slowness.
